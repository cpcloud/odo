Improved Backends
-----------------

* Pandas now includes an edge from ``datetime.datetime`` to
  ``pandas.Timestamp`` (:issue:`329`).
* Pandas now includes an edge from ``NoneType`` to ``pandas.Timestamp``.
  Pandas now includes an edge from
  ``pandas.tslib.NaTType`` to ``pandas.Timestamp``
  (:issue:`3321).
* :func:`~odo.odo.odo` now accepts a new keyword argument `bind` which is the
  sqlalchemy engine to use when executing the sql commands. This allows us to
  odo to or from an unbound sqlalchemy object (:issue:`305`).
* Support ``decimal`` datashapes in the SQL backend (:issue:`337`).
* Add ``timeout`` parameter to the ``URL`` backend (:issue:`346`).

API Changes
-----------

* Removed support for Python 2.6 (:issue:`333`).
* Removed support for Python 3.3 (:issue:`335`).
* ``pandas.DataFrame`` no longer discovers float32 and float64 as option types
  (:issue:`366`).
* ``pandas.Series`` now discovers strings and datetimes as option types
  (:issue:`366`).

Bug Fixes
---------

* Pandas backend now supports conversion from `nan` to `pandas.NaT`
  (:issue:`331`).
* MySQL uses something other than ``sa.NUMERIC`` for native decimal types
  (:issue:`338`).
* Fix an issue where ``sqlalchemy.Float`` objects were discovered as ``Decimal``
  datashapes (:issue:`341`).
* Fix an issue where ``isdimension`` was being called on the first
  character of a datashape string instead of on a ``DataShape`` instance
  (:issue:`345`).
* Fixed an issue with :issue:`345` that broke Blaze (:issue:`347`).
* Fixed an issue where empty columns in a CSV file would be coerced to
  ``datetime`` instead of being left as strings (:issue:`342`).


Miscellaneous
-------------

* When a conversion fails we now raise a
  :class:`~odo.core.FailedConversionWarning` instead of printing the warning to
  stdout. This is a subclass of ``UserWarning`` (:issue:`323`).
